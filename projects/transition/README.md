# ngld-transition

An angular service that provides interface for animating changes to everything, greatly inspired by [d3-transition](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition).

Because this library involves the usage style in [Angular animations](https://angular.io/guide/animations), it would be very easy to get started if you have been familiar with Angular animations.

This library is initially designed to work with `<ngld-canvas>` in `@ngld/canvas`.
Because out of the box, this directive works as a general angular service and could be injected into any angular components, this library can be used independently outside of `@ngld` or linked-data contexts.
