# PanZoomDirective

An angular directive that make a svg element able to be zoomed and panned
through calculating its viewbox.

This library is initially designed to work with `<ngld-canvas>` in
`@ngld/canvas`.
Because out of the box, this directive works on general `svg` elements, this
library can be used independently outside of `@ngld` or linked-data contexts.
